# CHRONOS #

Chronos is a minimalistic time tracking application which I've created to learn
Ruby on Rails while making something I use every day. It doesn't have many
features or bling, it just tracks time and makes it easy for me to fill in
my monthly timesheets at work.

Since it is a learning app, don't judge my messy Ruby and/or Rails, it'll get
better given enough spare time. :)
